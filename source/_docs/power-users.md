Pantheon fosters a community for developers who are actively making use of the platform as professionals. If you are an active developer on the Pantheon platform, you may benefit from joining our [Slack community](https://pantheon-community-slackin.herokuapp.com/) or [Power Users mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/pantheon.io/forum/#!forum/power-users).

## Power User Topics

The Pantheon Community is not a support resource, but it is a source of great ideas, inspirations, and insights. Examples of recent conversation threads:

- Accessing the Apache Solr search index from an AngularJS app
- Decoupled website architecture
- Using symlinks for legacy file locations
- Controlling user access to environments
- Terminus tricks for Continuous Integration

The community is an excellent way to bounce ideas off other expert developers. It's also the best way to get early access to beta features and other Power User info.
