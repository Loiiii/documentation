Every site on Pantheon is given multiple environments (Dev, Test, and Live), each with their own unique Platform domains which are bound to isolated resources, and are uniquely addressible on the internet via Pantheon's own DNS. Environments spun up using [Multidev](/docs/multidev/) get the same treatment. Platform domains are configured as subdomains, and are generated by prefixing the environment to the site name:

- dev-site-name.pantheonsite.io
- test-site-name.pantheonsite.io
- live-site-name.pantheonsite.io
- multidev-env-site-name.pantheonsite.io

## Legacy Platform Domains
DNS configurations that use the `gotpantheon.com` or `pantheon.io` Legacy Platform domain will continue to work, as requests are permanently redirected to `pantheonsite.io`. However, we recommend switching the CNAME value from `gotpantheon.com` to `pantheonsite.io` within the domain's DNS provider to prevent unnecssary redirects and take advantage of uptime and reliability improvements.

## Platform Domains as CDN Origin

Customers frequently use CDNs on top of Pantheon, and are free to use Platform domains for this purpose. They can rely on Pantheon's HTTPS edge to insure secure communications between their CDN provider, and their "origin" instance on Pantheon. For an example of this use-case, see [Adding HTTPS For Free With Cloudflare](/docs/guides/cloudflare-enable-https/).

Customers using the platform in this way cannot use Legacy Platform domains. They must update their configuration to use a `pantheonsite.io` domain. 

## Vanity Domains
Pantheon Partners, Strategic Partners, Enterprise accounts, Resellers, and OEM Partners have the ability to replace `pantheonsite.io` for each environment on every site they run with a custom vanity domain.

For details, see [Vanity Domains](/docs/vanity-domains/).
