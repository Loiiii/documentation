In less than five minutes, you can have your own site up and running on Pantheon.

## Create a Site

1. From your User Dashboard, click **Create New Site**.
2. Enter a name for your site. You cannot change the name of a site after creating it. A development URL will be automatically generated for you, at our pantheonsite.io domain.
3. Select your framework. Choose WordPress, Drupal 7, Drupal 8, or any of the distributions available on the platform.
4. On the Site Dashboard, click **Visit Development Site** to complete the installation process for the framework you selected.

## Free Sites

Free sites are useful for trying out the Pantheon platform, creating sandboxes for development, or for starting a new client project. We allocate two free sandbox sites for all user accounts. If you have reached your limit of Sandbox sites, delete an unused site or take a site live. If you're building sites for third parties, sign up for [Pantheon for Agencies](https://pantheon.io/agencies/pantheon-for-agencies). If you're at an educational institution, sign up for [Pantheon for EDU](https://pantheon.io/pantheon-top-edu).

## Your Pantheon Account
Your account is your own individual account, and every account can manage multiple projects or sites at a time. Pantheon doesn't recommend sharing your account with other people. If you're collaborating on a project or handing over ownership to a client, use our  team management and ownership transfer tools.
