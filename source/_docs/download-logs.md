Logs help you find, debug, and isolate current or potential problems on your live site. You can automate the process of accessing and maintaining these logs with a simple script.

## Enable Passwordless Access
Logs are stored within application containers that house your site's codebase and files. [Add an SSH key](/docs/generate-ssh-key/) within your User Dashboard to enable passwordless access and avoid authentication prompts. Otherwise, provide your Pantheon Dashboard credentials when prompted.

## Create Script
Open terminal and run the following commands to create and access a new local directory:
```
mkdir $HOME/site-logs
cd $HOME/site-logs
```
Using your favorite text editor, create a file within the `site-logs` directory called `collect-logs.sh` and save the following:
```
# Replace SITE with value from Dashboard URL
SITE=xxxxxxxxxxx
ENV=live
for app_server in `dig +short appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in`;
do
  rsync -rlvz --size-only --ipv4 --progress -e 'ssh -p 2222' $ENV.$SITE@appserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in:logs app_server_$app_server
done

# Include MySQL logs
db_server=`dig dbserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in +short`
rsync -rlvz --size-only --ipv4 --progress -e 'ssh -p 2222' $ENV.$SITE@dbserver.$ENV.$SITE.drush.in:logs db_server_$db_server
```
## Collect Logs
Download logs by executing the script from within the `site-logs` directory:
```
sh collect-logs.sh
```
You can now access the logs from within the `site-log` directory. More than one directory is generated for sites that use multiple application containers.
