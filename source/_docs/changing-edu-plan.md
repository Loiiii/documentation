Pantheon offers multiple service levels, called [Plans](https://pantheon.io/pricing). You can select the plan that works best for you and your needs. In the beginning, you can start with a Sandbox or Personal plan. Then once you start to grow and have more specific requirements, take a look at the Professional or Business plans, which can be part of the recipe to get your site or application to scale and perform better.

Only an Organization Administrator can immediately change the service level of a site. Team Members need to follow the organization's specific instruction to change the plan.

## Change the Service Level (Org Admin)

1. From your Site Dashboard, select **Settings**.
2. Select the new plan from the drop-down menu, and click **Update Plan**.
