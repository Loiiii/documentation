The Pantheon Drupal 8 upstream that you use to spin up a new Drupal 8 site on Pantheon will contain all the files that are required to enable verbose debugging. 

You can enable verbose debugging in Drupal 8 by using .yml files that contain environment-specific settings and are located in the sites/default directory. 

This Drupal 8 debugging setup takes into account that verbose debugging output is only ever meant to appear on Dev. The steps outlined below are designed to achieve only that and prevent debugging output and performance-hurting settings from getting deployed to Live unintentionally. See: [Creating a services.yml File for Drupal 8](/docs/services-yml/).

1. Enable twig debugging.
 1. Rename the provided default.services.pantheon.preproduction.yml to services.pantheon.preproduction.yml 
 2. Twig debugging will output HTML comments in the web page source showing every twig template used and the path to the template. (In order to prevent verbose debugging from accidentally displaying on Test or Live, this preproduction services file will only get loaded on Dev by the settings.pantheon.php file.)

2. Set logging to verbose, disable CSS/ JS aggregation.
 1. Rename the provided example.settings.local.php to settings.local.php
 2. Optionally in settings.local.php (only change these cache settings if you understand the consequences):
 3. Uncomment: # $settings['cache']['bins']['render'] = 'cache.backend.null';
 4. Uncomment: # $settings['cache']['bins']['dynamic_page_cache'] = 'cache.backend.null';
 
3. Get more debugging depth from the Devel module (optional).
 1. Download and install Devel module:
 ```
 drush en devel -y
 ```
 2. Enable the included Web Profiler module (D8 only):
 ```
 drush en webprofiler
 ```

## Settings and Services Files for Drupal 8 on Pantheon

For reference, this is the inclusions and loading order of settings and services files for Drupal 8 on Pantheon:

<table class="table  table-bordered table-responsive">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>default.settings.php copied to settings.php</td>
      <td> (occurs upon site installation)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>default.services.yml copied to services.yml </td>
      <td>(optional, done by developer, not automatic)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>settings.php</td>
      <td>includes: 
   services.yml (if found) [template file: default.services.yml]
   settings.pantheon.php (contains custom Pantheon settings, must always be included)â€¨   settings.local.php (if found)  [template file: example.settings.local.php]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>settings.pantheon.php</td>
      <td> includes:
   services.pantheon.preproduction.yml (loads on Dev only)   [template file: default.services.pantheon.preproduction.yml]
      or
   services.pantheon.production.yml (loads on Test and Live)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>settings.local.php</td>
      <td>includes:
   development.services.yml</td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>
