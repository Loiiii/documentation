## Platform Improvements

**Cloud Integration Tools**  
We released a [suite of tools](https://pantheon.io/blog/move-stack-cloud-integration-tools-drupal-and-wordpress-developers) comprised of Quicksilver Platform Hooks, a new release of our Terminus command-line interface, a new YAML-based project configuration interface, and broad compatibility with SAML for centralized authentication.  

Examples of what you can do with the Cloud Integration Tools:

* Update your internal issue tracker (e.g. JIRA) based on activity on Pantheon
* Automatically sanitize Dev databases after cloning content from Live
* Post notifications to Slack of platform actions to keep your teams in sync
* Clear CDN caches on deploy
* Integrate almost anything via simple webhooks
