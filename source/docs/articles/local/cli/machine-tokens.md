Machine tokens are used to uniquely identify your machine and securely authenticate via Terminus.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<h4>Note</h4>
Currently, this is  possible using <a href="https://github.com/pantheon-systems/cli#installing-with-git">installations of Terminus based on the master branch</a>. This feature will be rolled into the 0.11.0 release.</div>

Machine tokens:    

- Provide the same access as your username and password
- Can only be viewed when youâ€™re creating it
- Should be revoked when no longer used to help keep your account safe

## Create a Machine Token

1. From your User Dashboard, click **Account**, and select [Machine Tokens](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/users/#account/tokens/).
2. Click **Create Token**.
3. Enter a token name, and click **Generate Token**.
4. Copy and save your machine token now, as you will not be able to view or edit it later.
5. Click **I understand** to continue.

## Authenticate into Terminus
Use your token to authenticate into Terminus by running the following command:  
`terminus auth login --machine-token=<machine token>`

## Revoke a Machine Token

For security purposes, we recommend removing tokens from your account when they are no longer used.   

1. From your User Dashboard, click **Account**, and select [Machine Tokens](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/users/#account/tokens/).
2. Locate the token you want to delete, and click **Revoke Token**.
3. Type **Revoke**, and click **I understand the consequences. Revoke this token.**

## Benefits of Using Machine Tokens

- Bot Users with machine tokens can use Terminus to authenticate to and operate on Pantheon from a Continuous Integration (CI) server.
- Users in organizations with SAML Single-Sign On (SSO) can authenticate with terminus.
