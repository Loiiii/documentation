Pantheon maintains multiple plugins to facilitate its workflow within WordPress. The [Pantheon plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/WordPress/tree/master/wp-content/mu-plugins/pantheon) encourages updating plugins and themes in the Development environment and using Pantheon's git-based upstream core updates.

It should always be enabled for all sites on Pantheon, and should be fine to leave enabled if you export the site locally or to another environment.

In addition to the must-use Pantheon plugin in our WordPress upstream, you can download and install the [WP Redis](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-redis/) and [Pantheon Sessions](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-native-php-sessions/) plugins to use native PHP sessions or back your WP Object cache with Redis.

Please feel free to contact us if you have any concerns with these plugins.
