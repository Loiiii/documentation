In a few simple steps, your site will be up and running on our distributed infrastructure with no single points of failure.</p>
## Create Your Free Account
If you haven't already done so, create your [free Pantheon account](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/register).
## Create a Site
<img src="/source/docs/assets/images/icon-developer-dashboard.svg" alt="Launch Icon" style="padding-top:2px;float:right;margin-left:10px;margin-right:15px;margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:0px;border:0;max-height:80px;"><p style="padding-top:0px;">Pantheon offers two free sandbox sites for all user accounts. When one of your sites converts to a <a href="https://pantheon.io/pricing">paid plan</a>, you can start another sandbox site. If you need additional development sites, contact us and we'll be happy to work with you.</p>

Visit your Dashboard to [create a site](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/create).

### Start From Scratch

1. **Choose a distribution**.  
To start development directly on Pantheon, select a start state from our available distributions. For details, see [Choosing Your Start State](/docs/articles/sites/create/choosing-start-state).

2. **Visit the Dev installation**.  
On the Site Dashboard, click **Visit Development Site** to open the Development environment.  You'll then be prompted to complete the Drupal or WordPress installation forms.  

### Import an Existing Site

If you have an existing Drupal or WordPress site that you want to import, choose <strong>Import manually</strong>. For details, see <a href="/docs/articles/sites/migrate">Migrate Sites to Pantheon</a>.</p>

## Interact With Your Code
There are two ways to add and update your site's code: Git source code management and SFTP.</p>

### Git Connection Mode
Git is a well-known, industry standard version control system for managing code. For more information, see [Starting with Git](/docs/articles/local/starting-with-git).

**Add an SSH Key**  
From your User Dashboard, select **Account**, and click **SSH Keys**.
For detailed instructions, see [Generating SSH Keys](/docs/articles/users/generating-ssh-keys/).  

### SFTP Connection Mode
You can develop directly on the server using [SFTP mode](/docs/articles/sites/code/developing-directly-with-sftp-mode/).

## Pantheon Credentials
Your [Pantheon Dashboard](https://dashboard.pantheon.io) credentials are used to manage sites, organizations, and support tickets. Users on your Pantheon hosted sites will be distinct and are not managed by Pantheon; there is no single sign-on between the Dashboard and Drupal or WordPress site.

Find more Pantheon provided credentials in the site Dashboard. For more details, see:

## Known Limitations
Familiarize yourself with Pantheon's [known limitations](/docs/articles/sites/known-limitations) now to reduce headaches later.

## Prepare for Launch
Ensure a successful launch by following our best practice checklist for [Going Live](/docs/articles/going-live) on Pantheon.
