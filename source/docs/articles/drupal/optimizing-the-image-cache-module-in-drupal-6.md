ImageCache is a widely used Drupal 6 contributed module for dynamically generating thumbnails and other derivative images. Unfortunately, its internal logic relies heavily on a locally attached filesystem and suffers from performance issues in cloud environments like Pantheon.

To help with this, we have produced a patch that can be applied against the latest version of ImageCache (2.0-rc2). You can download the patch [here](http://pantheon-content.s3.amazonaws.com/patches/imagecache_pantheon.patch).
