## Pull Requests

It's important that moderators know what follow up actions are required when Pull Requests are issued. That makes creating a detailed Pull Requests essential to the process. Each PR should include the following:

  - **Purpose Statement**: Start by explaining why it should be merged. All requests should communicate the full scope of edits made. Don't assume familiarity with the history of any task.
  - **Associated Links**: Have a Sprint.ly task? Reference it.
    - ex: completes item:92 draft
  - **Review Needed**: Be clear about what you expect to come from this request. If you would like feedback, tag who should review it and what should happen next.
  - If a request is issued to create a dialogue between contributors, include the prefix **WIP** indicating that the PR is a work in progress. This will help moderators know what's ready and what's not ready to go into production.

### Merge Instructions

When the doc has received a +1 from a founder and editor. Merge and publish it. Delete the branch. Any fixes noticed after the fact will enter a normal update workflow.
