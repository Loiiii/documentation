Select a Plan and Add a Credit Card:

1. From your User Dashboard, choose the site you want to add a card to.
2. Select **Settings**.
3. Choose a plan.  
Depending on the plan you choose, you'll get access to additional features like adding a custom domain name to your site, or for Pro accounts and higher, adding SSL and more. For more information on plans and features, see [Pricing](https://pantheon.io/pricing).
4. Invite someone to pay for the site or enter the credit card information, and click **Update Billing**.

## Accessing Premium Features

Developing your site and enjoying the advanced features like Workflow, Team Management, and New Relic can all be accessed for free; however, there are also premium features that require you to have a payment method associated with your site.

For example, when adding SSL you will be prompted to update your site's plan:
 ![To enable SSL - choose at least a Pro plan](/source/docs/assets/images/desk_images/309237.png)
Clicking the message will take you to the Billing page to either select a plan or to enter your payment information.
