##Add, Change, or Remove a File Extension to a MIME Type

####We will consider:
- Adding anything not present on Pantheon with the recommendation of IANA list
- Adding anything not on the IANA list as application/octet-stream
- Changing any existing suffix that does not match the IANA MIME types

####We will not consider:
- Adding anything that conflicts with the IANA list
- Removing existing MIME types that are in IANA
- Changing our default MIME type

##Canonical Reference
See the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority [Media Type List](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml).

##Workaround
Depending on the file type, you can write a small PHP wrapper to read the file, set the MIME type header, and send back the file with any MIME type you want. Make sure to add caching headers to cache on the edge so that PHP doesnâ€™t have to do too much reading/writing.
