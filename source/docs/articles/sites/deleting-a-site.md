At some point, you may need or want to delete one of your sites on Pantheon. Deleting a site requires just a few simple steps.

### Delete Your Site

Click the **Settings** link in the upper-right corner of your site's workspace.

Click on the **Delete Site** tab. Click the **Delete Site** button to launch the confirmation dialog.

You will notice that the confirmation dialog requires you to enter the site title; this ensures you're aware of the site you're deleting. There is no recovery. There is no undo. Make sure you've downloaded a backup if you need any code, content, or files from the site.

After deleting a site, you will be returned to your Sites & Account dashboard. Note you'll have an extra Dev site slot since you just deleted a site.
