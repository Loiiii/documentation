The Organization Dashboard is where you manage all your sites in a single location. You can access support tickets, add or remove team members, and manage new or existing sites.

## Add Users to Your Organization

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<strong>Note</strong>: Only existing Pantheon users may be added to your organization. If you want all new users whose email addresses are on your company's domain to automatically be added to your org upon registration, please contact your account executive.
</div>
1. Click on the **People tab**.
2. Click **Add user**.
3. Enter the user's email address.
4. Choose the user's role.
5. Click **Add user**.

If the user does not exist on Pantheon, please direct them to  [https://dashboard.pantheon.io/register](https://dashboard.pantheon.io/register) and add them when their account is active. If your organization is set up to automatically add users with email addresses on your domain, simply ask them to create accounts on Pantheon with the correct email address.

## Add Sites to Your Organization

### New Sites

While creating a new site, any user in your org will see an "Organization Affiliation" select field containing any organizations to which he or she belongs. New sites affiliated this way are automatically added to your Organization Dashboard, and the user who creates the site is made the owner.

### Existing Sites

From the Site Dashboard you wish to add,


1. Click **Team**.
2. Click **Add Supporting Organization**.
3. Search for your organization.
4. Click **Add**.


## Manage Site Teams

From the Sites tab, you may add users to or remove them from site teams. Members of Ally, Partner, And Strategic Partner organizations already have access to all sites in the org. However, if you need to add developers as full team members to a site, or outside contractors to individual sites, you'll need to add them to the site team.

1. Check the box next to the site or sites you want to add the user to.
2. Click **Team** and **Add a team member**.
3. Enter the user's email address.
4. Click **Add team member**.

The user will receive an email notification with a link to the Site Dashboard.

Removing team members follows the same process.


## Filter Sites

At the sites tab, the left panel contains groups of filters, for limiting the sites list. Filters will appear in each group, as sites are added that match the filters. You can add custom tags by selecting sites by their checkbox, and clicking **Tags** and **Add Tag(s)**, then writing in the tag you want to add.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<strong>Note</strong>: Tags are case-sensitve.
</div>
To remove tags, select the site(s) you want to remove, and follow the procedure above, this time selecting **Remove Tag**, or by hovering over the tag and clicking the **x** that appears.
